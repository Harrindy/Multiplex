# Multiplex
This repository contains R programs for the article, “Array testing with multiplex assays,” by Peijie Hou and others. This article has been submitted to Biostatistics for publication. A Shiny application developed from these programs is available at https://dwang.shinyapps.io/MultiGTSiM/.

To run the code: 
Download the files ArrayMultiplex.R, Array.cpp, and Hierarchical.cpp to your computer. 
Open R (or Rstudio) and run ArrayMultiplex.R.
Make sure that R (or Rstudio) can access the Rcpp files Array.cpp and Hierarchical.cpp.

To reproduce the analysis (Tables 2 and 3) in the real data example (Section 5) of this article:
Download the files IowaSHLdata.csv (this is the data file), IowaSHLresults.R, Array.cpp, and Hierarchical.cpp to your computer. 
Open R (or Rstudio) and run IowaSHLresults.R.
Make sure that R (or Rstudio) can access the Rcpp files, Array.cpp and Hierarchical.cpp, and the data file IowaSHLdata.csv.
